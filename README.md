Weather is the state of the earth's atmosphere at a given location and time. It is an ongoing,
data-intensive, multidimensional, chaotic, and chaotically dynamic procedure. These
characteristics make weather forecasting extremely difficult. Forecasting is the estimation of
unknown situations based on historical information. The application of science and technology to
predict atmospheric conditions at a specific location and time is called weather forecasting.
Meteorologists create weather forecasts by gathering quantitative data about the current state of
the atmosphere, land, and water and projecting how the atmosphere will change at a specific
location using meteorology.
Globally, weather forecasting is one of the most difficult scientific and technological problems of
the last century. Indeed, making accurate forecasts is one of the greatest challenges
meteorologists face on a global scale. The purpose of weather prediction is to give knowledge
that can be used to reduce weather-related losses and promote societal advantages, such as the
protection of life and property, public health and safety, and the promotion of economic growth
and quality of life. Since antiquity, weather forecasting has been one of the most fascinating and
intriguing fields. Scientists have attempted to predict meteorological characteristics using a
variety of techniques, some of which are more precise than others. Frequently, weather
predictions are generated by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere
and projecting the future evolution of the atmosphere using scientific knowledge of atmospheric
processes.


The practice of weather forecasting involves predicting the future state of the atmosphere.
Ground observations, observations from ships, observations from airplanes, radio noises, doppler
radar, and satellites are used to determine the current weather conditions. This data is transmitted
to meteorological centers, where it is collected, processed, and compiled into various charts,
maps, and graphs. Modern high-speed computers convert the tens of thousands of observations
into maps of the surface and upper atmosphere. First, we collect meteorological data from
numerous websites and academic articles. For this specific research, NASA's weather collection
department assisted us in collecting data from the state of Washington in the United States. After
preprocessing the acquired data, we will utilize machine learning models to forecast the weather.

Accurate weather forecast models are essential for nations whose whole agricultural sector is
weather-dependent.
Identifying any patterns in weather parameters deviating from their periodicity, which could
damage the nation's economy, is, therefore, a serious concern. The threat of global warming and
the greenhouse effect have exacerbated this concern. Extreme weather occurrences have an
increasingly costly effect on society, including infrastructure damage, injuries, and deaths.



The weather was forecast using a Recurrent Neural Network. RNN is a Deep Learning algorithm
used for Time Series Analysis.
In the area of supervised deep learning, Recurrent Neural Networks are among the most
sophisticated algorithms.
Neural networks with hidden states are a type of neural network that may use past outputs as
inputs.
RNN features a "memory" notion that remembers all information about what has been calculated
up to time step t. RNNs are referred to as recurrent because they do the same task for each
element of a sequence, with the result dependent on past calculations.
The idea behind RNN is that weights have LTM or Long memory. In a traditional ANN, for
instance, the weights are known, so the network will process any input in the same manner as it
did yesterday. Because the Temporal Lobe is important for Long Term (LTM), the weights may
be found in the Temporal Lobe of the human brain.
RNN is like short-term memory in that it can remember things that have happened in the last few
observations.
